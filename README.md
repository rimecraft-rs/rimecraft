###### <p align="center">**Rimecraft** is committed to becoming a fully-featured, flexible and libre Rust implementation of **[Minecraft.](https://minecraft.net)**</p>

<br />

**[WIP]** Rimecraft is currently under _heavy development._

## Key Features

-   **Modular**: Destructing the whole codebase into individual crates.
-   **Flexible**: By using local and global contexts and write the code with flexibility kept in mind, it can be easily extended and customized.
-   **Corresponded**: At large scale, its codebase is corresponding to the codebase of _Java Edition_, makes it easier to adapt and maintain.
-   **Performant**: Thanks to Rust and LLVM, it is able to be fast and efficient.

## Quick Start

Rimecraft is currently not ready yet for play as it only consists of a set of lib crates.

So for now you can:

-   **Generate and read the docs** using `cargo doc --workspace --all-features`.
-   **Run the tests** using `cargo test --workspace --all-features`.
-   **Get Involved** by contributing to the project.
